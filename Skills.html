    <li>Multitasking</li>
    <p>Multitasking, from a human perspective, is the ability to manage and perform several activities at the same time, or rapidly switch between them. It involves juggling different tasks—like working on a project, answering emails, and talking to someone—while maintaining some level of focus and productivity on each. Humans often multitask by blending simple, automatic tasks (like walking) with more complex ones (like thinking or writing), but doing multiple complex tasks at once can lead to reduced performance and errors.</p>
    <li>Time Management</li>
    <p>Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between different activities to increase efficiency and productivity. It involves setting goals, prioritizing tasks, allocating time for each task, and minimizing distractions. Effective time management helps you get more done in less time, reduces stress, and allows for better work-life balance.
